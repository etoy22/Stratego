IMPORTANT!!!

1. To setup a multiplayer game, StrategoServer must be run first. The computer which runs this is known as the HOST
2. After opening the server, run StrategoClient on the other computer. This computer is known as the CLIENT
3. On the HOST computer, click "This PC" (Top left icon) and give the name of the computer to the person running 
	StrategoClient (The name begins with C-)
4.When prompted, the CLIENT must input the name of the HOST. (CAPS MATTER!!! DON'T FORGET THE C- AT THE BEGINNING)
	(If the name is input incorrectly, you must rerun StrategoServer and StrategoClient in the same order)
5.HOST must place their pieces first, then client can place their pieces.
6.Rules are the same as local
7.Play as normal
