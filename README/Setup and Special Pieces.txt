Stratego

By: Ethan Leider and Manny Sun

////////////////////////////////////////////////////

The goal of Stratego is to capture the flag of your opponent while defending your own flag.
To capture the flag you use your army of 40
Pieces have a rank and represent individual officers and soldiers in an army. 
In addition to those ranked pieces you can use bombs to protect your flag.

Setup
- The Stratego board consists of 10 x 10 squares. Players set their pieces up in the bottom four rows that are closest to them.  

- Place the pieces

Moving
- Pieces move one square per turn, horizontally or vertically and not diagonally. (Except scouts special rules bellow)
- Pieces cannot jump over another piece. 
- Playing pieces are not permitted to move into the two lake obstacles (2 x 2 squares each) in the center of the board. 
- Bombs and flags may never move.

Attacking
- If a piece is moved onto a square occupied by an opposing piece, their identities are revealed. 
- The lower rank (lower number piece) is removed from the board, and the higher rank (higher number piece)
	is moved into the place formerly occupied by the weaker piece
- If the engaging pieces are of equal rank, they are both removed. 
- Pieces may not move onto a square already occupied by another piece without attacking.

Special Pieces

Bombs
- The bombs cannot be moved. 
- A bomb defeats every piece that tries to attack it, except the miner (3).
- Bombs remain on the field after defeating pieces until they are defused. 
- Bombs lose when they are attacked (defused) by a miner.

Flag
- The flag cannot be moved and loses an attack from every other piece. 
- When you capture the flag of your opponent you win the game.

Scouts
- Scouts can jump/move over an unlimited number of empty squares in a straight line to the left, right, forward or backward.
- They cannot jump over any pieces (friendly or enemy) and cannot jump over the lakes.
- Scouts are the only pieces that can launch an attack from a sizeable distance, but it must be in a straight line. 

Spy
- Exception to the rule of the higher rank winning is the spy.
- When the spy attacks the marshal, the spy defeats the higher ranked marshal. However, when the marshal attacks the spy, the spy loses.
